After all we are guarding the Star Apple tree.#$b#This question urged the others to wish upon these stars of the night sky to let them become starflies.#$b#However, the stars were really burning balls. So instead, the stars gave them fire inside their bodies.#$b#And since then, they were called fireflies, they lit up the tree at night making it safe for travelers and townsfolk to visit even during the dark.$h#$b#In addition to that, because of the fire given by the stars, people believe they could grant wishes.$h#$b#It's cute isn't?$h#$b#Makes you want to look for one right now.$h#$b#Okay, bye!!$h",
