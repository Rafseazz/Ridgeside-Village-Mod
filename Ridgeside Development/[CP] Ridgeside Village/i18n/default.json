"checkup.waiting.Corine": "Dr. Paula's just trying to do her job, Dad. So would you please just let her get on with it already?$5",
"checkup.married.Corine": "Hmm, how am I supposed to explain all these cuts and bruises to Paula?$2#$b#...Maybe I'll just say we were...experimenting in bed?$4#$b#Just kidding!$1#$e#But really, what on earth do I say to her?$3",
"checkup.Flor": "Really? So this has been proven to help social anxiety in studies?#$b#If it's quite alright, perhaps I could borrow the research paper from you later?$12",

"checkup.June": "Um, Dr. Paula? Exactly how frequent do frequent headaches need to be before it's a cause for concern? Weekly? Daily?$7#$b#And what about coughing? I'm a former smoker - Well, I'm trying to be one... How do I know if I have cancer?$7#$b#I mean, I used to go through pack after pack each day, for Yoba knows how long... Ugh, who am I kidding?

"checkup.waiting.June": "What are you doing here, @? Don't tell me you came all this way just because you were worried about my health.$6#$b#Well, there's no cause for concern. I may have passed the half-fifty mark, but I'm still plenty young. So don't worry about me.$8",
"checkup.married.June": "@! Thank goodness you're here. Going to the doctor's always fills my head with the inescapable thought of my own mortality...$7#$b#Honey...Can-Can I hold your hand? I might squeeze too hard, but you can just kiss my cheek to calm me down.$s",
"checkup.Ian": "The doc says I need to rest more. I don't get it. I sleep at least two hours every night?",

"checkup.married.Jeric": "We just finished up, babe, and it's official – you've got the healthiest husband in the valley!",
"checkup.Kenneth": "Dr. Paula and I have similar jobs. Just like I have to maintain all the wiring to keep machines working before something bad happens, she helps keep everyone's body working before something bad happens.",

"checkup.Ezekiel": "A check-up? Bah! I haven't had so much as a cold since I was in diapers!",
"checkup.waiting.Ezekiel": "You know, I definitely prefer Paula here to that quack over in Pelican Town.#$b#How am I supposed to trust a man with my life if I can't even trust him to make it through basic training?",
"checkup.Freddie": "What's that? Head trauma? Well, what can I say, I was quite the fighter back in my day!",
"checkup.waiting.Freddie": "%Freddie's fast asleep.",

"checkup.Lola": "...Oh, no, dear, I haven't smoked once my whole life.#$b#...Well, I used to have a glass of wine a couple nights a week, but now even white wine gives me a headache. So no.#$b#...Oh, I'd say ours is active. *Very* active.$1",

"checkup.waiting.Pika": "Keahi, sit still, would you? The doctor can't examine you if you keep squirming around like there's a Lava Eel down your pants.$5",
"checkup.Richard": "Hohoho, don't worry about me, @! Don't you know Ridgeside is famous for its long-lived men?$h",

"checkup.waiting.Trinnie": "Sometimes I wish I was a plant. Plants don't have to go to the doctor.$s#$b#On the other hand, plants can't play hide and seek or eat cake!",

"checkup.waiting.Kimpoi": "Doctor, could Malaya skip the knee-jerk test, please? My wife has, uh, delicate knees...$2",
"checkup.Anton": "@! How's it going?#$b#*whispers* Honestly, I'm kinda glad you're here. Having Paula look me over like this is... weird, to say the least.",

"checkup.Blair": "Mamá, can't you please stay in the waiting room? I'm an adult now, and these are supposed to be private.$5",
"checkup.waiting.Blair": "The doctor says I've grown up quite well. What do you think, @? Am I a woman in your eyes, or just a little girl?$1",

"checkup.Faye": "Oh, hello, @. Is it customary in the countryside to have a friend sit in on these? I'm always up for new experiences, but this is definitely different.",

The father told the daughter to hide.#$b#When the maiden descended with a rope, she was transformed into a beautiful orchid.#$h#$b#One with red dots on its light lavender petals.#$b#The father was left heartbroken, and the Rajah collected the orchids and displayed them across the trees of the kingdom in honor of the young maiden.$s#$b#And that was that.#$b#Such a beautiful but tragic story about a pretty flower, don't you think?$h",

After all we are guarding the Star Apple tree.#$b#This question urged the others to wish upon these stars of the night sky to let them become starflies.#$b#However, the stars were really burning balls. So instead, the stars gave them fire inside their bodies.#$b#And since then, they were called fireflies, they lit up the tree at night making it safe for travelers and townsfolk to visit even in the dark.$h#$b#In addition to that, because of the fire given by the stars, people believe they could grant wishes.$h#$b#It's cute, isn't it?$h#$b#Makes you want to look for one right now.$h#$b#Okay, bye!!$h",

//RSV Secret Notes
"RSV.secretnote.-75160": "Miner's Diary, Chapter 1^^Summer 4th, Year -504^We set up a proper camp in this place a couple of weeks ago and I've already seen something you just would not believe. The other night a darned star fell right out of the sky and landed into that valley just a few kilometers down south. Now a group of people are thinking of going to scope it out, see if it's dangerous or not-- Maybe it could be useful to us.^^Summer 17th, Year -504^The scouts just came back the other night, said that star was nowhere to be found just a hole and some rubble where it should be. Though they said that valley was something to behold, even without the star. An abundant land with apparently more forage to be had and fish to catch than we'd know what to do with. Said it's even got quarry filled with ore on the eastern side. Sounds like as perfect a place as any to set up a proper town. The rest of us are gonna make our way on over after we pack up the rest of camp. It takes about 3 days time on horseback.^^Fall 22nd, Year -504^After about a month's time, we finally got something set up that we could call a town. There was a nice spot between the mountain and the ocean that we decided to settle down in. It's a good town for fishing and mining. We decided to call it Pelican Town. Once we get some boats up and running this could have a real nice bustling port going on, should bring in new people to the valley. The wildlife here is all friendly, too, 'cept for the monsters in the cave by the mountain. But there's this little turtle we found when we started settling, been real fond of us. It seems like the little feller has been here for quite a bit, but it's nice to have him around to keep us company.",

"RSV.secretnote.-75161": "Miner's Diary, Chapter 2^^Winter 20th, Year -504^Life in this valley has started to show its share of difficulty. I thought the monsters in the mines were a big enough problem, but the cold here is like nothing I have ever encountered before. No crops can grow in this brutal cold, 'cept for these snow yams you see rarely, though there's not enough for the town to survive on. We've barely been getting by on fishing, but the rations we made before winter have been running low. I'm starting to fear what'll happen to this town. Some of the towns folk are gonna trek up the mountain, see if they can't find some forage up there. I'm doubtful... but hell, what do we have to lose?^^Winter 22nd, Year -504^Folks in town have been talking about that bright star in the sky... For some reason we have only been able to see just how bright it is this winter. Some of the more superstitious folks have been saying it brings good luck and we're blessed to see it. With how this winter has been going, I wonder if we're blessed or cursed to be here. I will say, though, that there is something comforting about seeing that light in the sky.^^Winter 24th, Year -504^We lost some people to the cold these past few days. I just hope we don't lose any more. The forage team just got back and they were at least able to find some food. Sadly, not enough to last longer than a day or two. But maybe our luck will change... Winter shouldn't last too much longer, so we just gotta hold on until spring comes. I've been trying to give some of the kids and the older folks a bite of my share of food. Yoba knows they need it more than I do. I even gave a bit of my ration to that little turtle in town-- Don't know how the feller is surviving in this weather, let alone finding food. Least I can do is give him some food and a blanket to keep 'im warm.^^Winter 25th, Year -504^By Yoba, a damned miracle happened today. When I awoke and came out this morning, I found my yard filled with them snow yams! Apparently the mariners said their fishing lines were filled as well! It's like Yoba heard our cries and came to feed us themselves. Even one of the stars down in the Alden's house turned into this purple fruit. I don't know what happened last night, but I won't question these gifts. Thanks to this miracle, we can make it to spring without worry.",

"RSV.secretnote.-75162": "Dear Governor,^^   I think your proposal to build a new town in the neighboring mountains is most likely our best course of action. With the new railway being built into our town, there has been a marked influx of travelers here. Also, with a possible war looming, I'm worried about what could happen to our town. It's over two centuries old, and was built without defense in mind. That being said, some of the folks in town went with me to scope out an area to start construction. I think we found just the place-- There's a nice flat spot with a river going through it, leading from a waterfall to the north. I saw something strange up there, though-- A tortoise... Isn't that just peculiar? I've heard stories of a tortoise being around when Pelican Town was created... I guess he must be an ancestor of his.^But I digress. I did want to mention that it would be difficult to haul all the needed construction materials up the mountain. If we have the funding, maybe it would be best to have one of those new funiculars built? Well, just let me know your thoughts on the matter, and if you agree, we can get started right away.^^   - Mayor Maynard^^P.S. I'm thinking of naming it \"Ridgeside Village\"-- Sounds quaint, don't you think?",

  "event-75160407.24": "Let me start from the beginning. My tale will answer that question and many more, dear spirit.#As you have likely surmised, I am not a spirit like you, but a Lesser Deity - a guardian of this planet.#When this realm was created, my kin and I were birthed along with it. Our task is to protect it - to ensure that the balance of nature is never overturned.#In the past, I was much more lenient when it came to my true form. I never saw any reason to disguise myself from the humans.#I had even come to trust a group of them, for a time.#But in the face of power, human hearts are quickly seized by greed. They sought to use my powers for their petty wars and indulgent campaigns.#Once, I decided to aid a village that I had grown quite fond of in their military efforts... It was a long, arduous war in which I used my own powers to harm the very creatures I was meant to protect.#Not long after that, I decided to keep myself hidden from them - for both my sake and theirs.#And so I adopted the humble guise that you have come to know, dear spirits.",
  "event-75160407.25": "But how can you fulfill your duty of protection in such a diminished form?$s#$b#Surely there are ways to help humanity without completely recusing yourself from their affairs...?$s#$b#Those people believed in you, and you yourself said that you cared for them - but you abandoned them...$s",
  "event-75160407.26": "Your words have some truth to them, though it pains me to admit it. But I do not regret my actions.#I have never had any desire for humanity's love or worship. The task my kin and I were presented with is a lonely one, but nonetheless one I do not take lightly.#As a nature spirit yourself, you know as well as I that the balance of nature is easily swayed. Any semblance of favoritism on my part could swiftly prove disastrous for both humanity and the planet's development.#We watch over humans, animals, monsters, and even spirits such as you two. Were I to give my assistance only to a select few, they would thrive, yes - but the other creatures would indubitably pay the price.#What right have I, a supposed guardian, to sentence so many to such a fate?",
  "event-75160407.27": "That being said, I do not recall ever saying that I stopped assisting the humans entirely... *wink*",
  "event-75160407.28": "Well, then... With this, I have given you two something to think about with regard to your own places in the universe.#Farewell, dear spirits. I'll be following your journeys with only the highest of expectations.",

I consider myself an introvert, but I guess I got excited to have someone to talk to.#$b#I'm just so used to my morning routine of coming here by myself.$2#$b#It's relaxing, don't get me wrong, but I forgot what it's like to have someone next to me.$1#$b#It's nice...$4",

  "June.six_heart.6": "That's quite an understatement.$1",
  "June.six_heart.7": "Say, didn't you use to live in Zuzu City before coming here? How does it compare?",
  "June.six_heart.8": "To be honest, it's kind of dull here. I miss the bustling city life.",
  "June.six_heart.9": "It's hard to say which is better. They both have their pros and cons.",
  "June.six_heart.10": "I love it here. Life has never been so peaceful.",
  "June.six_heart.11": "Hm, I can see why you'd feel that way. But personally that \"dullness\" is my favorite part.",
  "June.six_heart.12": "Very true. But one thing's for sure, the city doesn't have views like this.$1",
  "June.six_heart.13": "I agree completely. I'm so glad I decided to come work here, even if it's just for half the year.$1",
  "June.six_heart.14": "You know, I really admire you for being a farmer.#$b#The amount of time and effort you have to put into each day, the number of days where you're just scraping by till the next crop yield comes in...#$b#It must take so much discipline.$2",
  "June.six_heart.15": "You're really inspiring, is all. Compared to you I seem like a total slacker. Everyone does.$1",
  "June.six_heart.16": "Maybe, but still, I could never do what you do either.",
  "June.six_heart.17": "True, I am pretty impressive.",

  "June.seven_heart.10": "You're drunk?",
  "June.seven_heart.11": "What happened?",
  "June.seven_heart.12": "Well, Gus was telling me about this rare liquor he got from the traveling cart...$2#$b#Turns out it was my favorite rice wine from the Gotoro Empire, and... I may have, er, overindulged myself...$3",

  "June.eight_heart.1": "@? What are you doing here?$7",
  "June.eight_heart.2": "Actually, I'm glad you came. What happened by the Saloon... I feel like I should explain.$2",
  "June.eight_heart.3": "So, before I came here, I worked at a jazz bar in Zuzu City. It was everything I'd ever wanted in my music career.#$b#Every day I got to push my creative limits and play whatever came to me, surrounded by musicians who truly exceled at their instruments.#$b#It was honestly a dream come true.$1",
  "June.eight_heart.4": "But, I don't know... Something about it just didn't feel right. And for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why.$2#$b#Then one day I was smoking in the back alley, and I realized that... I didn't like who I was anymore.$2#$b#I couldn't even remember when I'd first picked up smoking, but I knew I didn't before I got there.$2",
  "June.eight_heart.5": "The jazz club environment was a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but it was almost too fun.#$b#I was always fulfilled musically, so I stopped challenging myself in other areas, and eventually the apathy became depression...$2",
  "June.eight_heart.6": "It's a strange feeling, realizing your dream job is both everything you ever wanted it to be and also nothing like you thought it was.$2",
  "June.eight_heart.7": "At the end of the day, I decided that I needed to find a path that was fulfilling more than just my passion for music.#$b#So I gave it all up and became a lobby pianist instead. Which brings me, well, here.",
  "June.eight_heart.8": "It's certainly humble work in comparison, but I finally feel like I'm at a good place, y'know?#$b#Now I live in a gorgeous landscape in a great community full of kind people. I still get to play music, and I feel more in touch with myself than ever.$1",
  "June.eight_heart.9": "Anyway, I wanted a clean slate mentally when I came here, so I didn't talk about it with, well, anyone.#$b#But as I got to know you, I realized I was ashamed of myself.$2",
  "June.eight_heart.10": "I mean, here I am complaining about how much it sucks to achieve my dream, feeling sorry for myself... and then there's you.$7#$b#You work harder than anyone I know. All by yourself, you're out there breaking your back on that farm every day - and you never expect so much as a thank you from anyone.$7",
  "June.eight_heart.11": "You're everything that I aspire to be. And I guess I just didn't want you to think any less of me...$2#$b#But then I slipped up, and you saw, and so... yeah. Here we are.$2",
  "June.eight_heart.12": "Why would that change my opinion of you? You're my friend, June.",
  "June.eight_heart.13": "Yikes. That's a lot to dump on me, you know.",
  "June.eight_heart.14": "You're always so kind to me. That's another thing I admire about you.$4",
  "June.eight_heart.15": "I was just trying to open up... I guess was mistaken in thinking that you care.$5",
  "June.eight_heart.16": "Thanks for listening to all that. I hope you know you can always come talk to me about anything if you need it.$1#$b#I care about you a lot, and I want to help you the way you've helped me.$4",
  "June.eight_heart.17": "Um, if it's alright... care to watch the waves with me for a while?$1",
  "June.eight_heart.after.1": "Talking to you always makes me forget what I was worried about in the first place.$8",
  "June.eight_heart.after.2": "I don't really want to talk to you right now.$5",

  "June.ten_heart.1": "@! You came to come visit me at work? That's so sweet.$8#$b#Here, come sit next to me on the bench.$1",
  "June.ten_heart.2": "Don't worry, it's fine! I was about to go on my break anyway.$1",
  "June.ten_heart.3": "Do you know how to play? I can teach you a bit if you want.$1#$b#First, you place your right thumb on the middle C. That's this key right here.#$b#Then you line up the rest of your fingers on the keys to right of it.#$b#Your other thumb goes right here, and then your left hand goes - yeah, you got it.",
  "June.ten_heart.4": "Why don't you try to play a song? Maybe Do Re Mi to start. That's C D E--#$b#Oh, you don't know what that means. Hm...$3#$b#Here, I'll put my hands over yours and we'll play together.$1",
  "June.ten_heart.5": "Hm... Sitting this close to you is awfully distracting.$9#$b#Suddenly I can't focus on the piano anymore...$9",
  "June.ten_heart.6": "June puts up a sign on the piano - \"On Break\".",
  "June.ten_heart.7": "Come with me, quick. There's something I need to say to you somewhere a bit more private.$1",
  "June.ten_heart.8": "Sorry to drag you up here. I just wanted some alone time with you.$1#$b#Can't go causing a scene in the workplace, y'know?$9",
  "June.ten_heart.9": "I'm so glad you came. Not that I hate my job or anything, of course not, but... Seeing you just makes me so happy.$1#$b#You know, I've never been one to believe in fate or any of that, but...#$b#It's only because I gave up my dream job that I came here and met you. And for that reason alone, I'd do it all again in a heartbeat.$4#$b#Whether my whole life has been me following in predestined footsteps to meet you, or if it's all just chance,$1#$b#I'm so grateful to be alive, to be with you.$4",
  "June.ten_heart.10": "It's funny, the sight of snow kind of makes me sad nowadays. Snow means it's winter, and winter means I have to leave you soon...$2",
  "June.ten_heart.11": "I would gladly spend the rest of my days sweating my hair gel off in the Calico Desert as long as I could spend them with you.$1",
  "June.ten_heart.12": "I... I love you, @.$4",
  "June.ten_heart.13": "I love you, too.",
  "June.ten_heart.14": "I'm sorry, I don't feel the same.",
  "June.ten_heart.15": "...$4#$b#Come say that again, but closer to my ear this time.$4",
  "June.ten_heart.16": "What? I thought-- I'm sorry... I should get back to work.$7",
  "June.ten_heart.17": "You know, there aren't any security cameras up here... Are you thinking what I'm thinking?$9",
  "June.ten_heart.after.1": "I'm so glad you know how I feel now, @.$4#$e#To be honest, it caught me by surprise - I've never felt like this about anyone before.$4",
  "June.ten_heart.after.2": "Um, sorry again, for my misunderstanding earlier...$7#$b#...Bye.$2",

  "June.fourteen_heart.1": "So, honey...",
  "June.fourteen_heart.2": "I heard from Willy that you've really done a lot for that island off the coast...#$b#You've even fixed up the old resort so that people can go visit the beach, huh?",
  "June.fourteen_heart.3": "You really are so impressive, you know that? I can't believe how much you've done for this town, this valley, all by yourself...$4",
  "June.fourteen_heart.4": "I want to go see your hard work for myself, but I just... hate hot weather..... so much........$2",
  "June.fourteen_heart.5": "But you know what? As long as you're there with me, I'm sure I'll have a wonderful time.$1#$b#Why don't we make a date out of it? We can even spend the night there at the vacation house you got for us.$8#$b#So how about you meet me at Willy's shop tomorrow - weather permitting, of course - and we'll go after everyone else has left?$1",
  "June.fourteen_heart.6": "Perfect! It's a date!$8#$b#Now I have to figure out where to buy those hydrophobic clothes people wear near water...$3#$b#Wait, what are they called?$7",
  "June.fourteen_heart.after.1": "'Swimwear'? I have literally never heard this term before in my life.$6",

  "June.fourteen_heart.7": "Oh good, you're here!$1#$b#I've got a bit of a surprise for you, actually.$1",
  "June.fourteen_heart.8": "You'll have to find out for yourself. So come on, let's get going!$8",
  "June.fourteen_heart.9": "So, what do you think? Are you surprised?$8",
  "June.fourteen_heart.10": "I know I am! I've never seen someone sweat as much as June did moving all that furniture out from the back, haha!$1",
  "June.fourteen_heart.11": "Yes, thank you, Pika!$3",
  "June.fourteen_heart.12": "...I promise I took a shower after.$2#$b#Anyway, you've just done so much for our family, the community, and really, well, everybody...$6#$b#So I know this is nothing in comparison to all the work you've done to make everyone's lives better, but I hope that I can bring you that happiness too,$4#$b#even if it's just for one night.$8",
  "June.fourteen_heart.13": "Don't be silly, honey. You make me happy every single day.",
  "June.fourteen_heart.14": "I haven't done that much. I just help out when I can, is all.",
  "June.fourteen_heart.15": "This is quite the secluded, romantic spot. So is Pika just here to cook, or...?",
  "June.fourteen_heart.16": "I knew you'd say that... but somehow it makes it even more meaningful.$4",
  "June.fourteen_heart.17": "There's no need to be humble. We just rode to a resort that you built on a boat that you helped repair, after all.$9#$b#But even if you don't want to take credit for that, there's no denying that you've given more than I ever knew I could receive.$4",
  "June.fourteen_heart.18": "..........$7#$b#Pfft! Oh man, just when I thought I'd heard it all, you still find ways to scandalize me!$8#$b#Yes, of course he's just cooking for us. Get your mind out of the gutter!$9",
  "June.fourteen_heart.19": "Hey, @... Before we go sit down, I just want to say, I love you so much. My life finally feels complete with you in it, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.$4#$b#...That's all. Well, not really. There's a million other things I want to say to you right now...$4#$b#But I'll save that for later tonight.$9#$b#Because right now, dinner awaits!$8",
  "June.fourteen_heart.20": "Now, care to show me that little island home you mentioned? I expect nothing less than the grand tour.$9",
  "June.fourteen_heart.after.2": "That was so lovely. Maybe I should go to the island more often...$1",

  "June.fair": "Don't mind me, I'm just grabbing a quiet moment to myself.",
  "June.fair.spouse": "All these tourists stress me out...$2#$b#Let's grab some barbecue to go and head home, where it's just us.$1",
  "June.gathering": "I wanted to get a good spot for the concert early, but there was a big group of people standing right in the prime location...$5#$b#How long do you think I should wait before going over?$3",
  "June.gathering.spouse": "Honey... Is it selfish of me to wish that I would get invited to play one day, too?$7",
  "June.spiritseve": "Ugh, just looking at that maze makes me feel claustrophobic...$3",
  "June.spiritseve.spouse": "You know, there're a lot of dark corners in that maze... Want to go get lost with me?$9",
  "June.fishing": "This time of year is so beautiful. I'm so grateful that the town comes together like this to celebrate each year.$1#$e#Hey, random question, do you think fish get cold?",
  "June.fishing.spouse": "Honey, you're not too cold, are you?$7#$b#We could sneak into an igloo to warm up if you want.$9",
  "June.nightmarket": "Have you tried the coffee? I highly recommend it.$1",
  "June.nightmarket.spouse": "The exotic coffee the trader brings is truly like nothing else.$1#$e#Did you know that the majority of the world's coffee beans actually come from that region?$1#$b#Because of that, the flavor has gotten milder of course, but the original bean has a very strong floral flavor, almost like wine when brewed correctly. This is due to the-$1#$b#...Oh wait, I'm doing it again, aren't I? Sorry.$4",
  "June.winterstar": "It's funny, I usually don't like these big events with huge crowds. But Winter Star is my favorite holiday precisely because of all of the people.$1#$b#I guess it's because on a day like today, the focus is on the community and the bonds we have. And I realize just how special they are to me.$8",
  "June.winterstar.spouse": "Today means so much more to me with you here next to me.$1#$b#Instead of just feeling like a part of this community, I actually belong to it. And it's all thanks to you, my love.$4",
  "June.ember": "I really love this festival. It always gives me a great memory to remember this town by before leaving.$1",
  "June.ember.spouse": "The brisk winter air contrasted with the warm glow of the bonfire is so invigorating.$1#$b#It almost makes me forget how much I want to go to bed.$8#$e#Almost...$2",
  "June.egghunt": "Word of advice, @ - Do NOT eat the free eggs on the ground. I don't know what they put on them, but they taste like old vinegar...$s#$b#...What do you mean they put vinegar on them?$7",
  "June.egghunt.spouse": "Seeing all the children so happy makes me feel happy, too... Is that weird?$4",
  "June.dance": "As someone not from around here, I've got to say, this whole gender-separated dancing ritual seems awfully cult-y... Don't you think, @?$3",
  "June.dance.spouse": "The spring flowers are beautiful... Maybe even more than the fall foliage!$8#$b#Just kidding! If I ever earnestly say spring is better than fall, assume I've been replaced by a doppelganger.$1",

  "June.spouseRoom.4": "This keyboard may not be as fancy as the one I play at the hotel, but it's still my favorite. You know why?$1#$b#Because it's the one I get to play for my family's ears only, and no one else's. And that's more rewarding to me than any pay could ever be.$l",
  "June.spouseRoom.5": "Why don't you stay inside with me today, honey? You can sit in my lap and be my muse while I write a song just for you.$1#$b#Or we could just make music together...$l",

  "lesson.1.June": "Exactly! It's a step above C, and a step below D!$h#$b#I've got to say, you're quite the quick learner, Yuuma.$h",
  "lesson.2.Yuuma": "Hmm... I don't know those people, but it sounds similar to a song I know by The Aphids.#$b#They're my dad's favorite band. He even saw them in college once.$h",
  "lesson.2.June": "So this four-chord progression is really common in modern music.$h#$b#Like in this Madam Lala song, or this one by Burgundy 4. Do you hear it?$h",
  "lesson.3.Yuuma": "Hm, that sounds a bit weird, I think...#$b#How about \"Ezekiel's Garden Beer Draws Flies\"?$1",
  "lesson.3.June": "A mnemonic device can be useful in memorizing the different staves.#$b#For example, the one I was taught for the treble clef was \"Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge\". But feel free to make up your own.$1",
  "lesson.4.Yuuma": "Oh, I don't need a piano, Mr. Choi. I just imagine the keys and pretend to play, like this.",
  "lesson.4.June": "You've memorized all the chords already? I'm impressed, Yuuma! Especially considering you don't have a piano to practice at home.$1",

  "lesson.6.Yuuma": "Mr. Choi, how did you know you wanted to play piano for a living?",
  "lesson.6.June": "Hmm, that's a good question, Yuuma...#$b#Well, I've always known that I want to play piano forever. And the best way to make sure I could do that was to do it for a living.#$b#It may not be on the level of doctor or lawyer, but at least I get to spend each day doing what I love.$1",
  "lesson.7.Yuuma": "Okay, Mr. Choi, but... I don't think knowing the names will help me when I can't reach the pedals anyway.$s",
  "lesson.7.June": "So, the leftmost pedal is called \"una corda\", or the soft pedal. The middle one is the sostenuto pedal, and the rightmost one is the sustaining pedal, or the damper.#$e#Oh, right... I'll look into getting a pedal extender for our lessons.$s",
  "lesson.8.Yuuma": "But Mr. Choi, how else am I supposed to reach all the keys? My hands aren't nearly as big as yours...$s",
  "lesson.8.June": "A lot of beginners try to stretch their hands out so that they can reach farther, but that just makes it harder to hit the right notes.#$b#What you want to do is keep your fingers slightly curved, like a claw motion, almost.",
  "lesson.9.Yuuma": "Two. Two halves make a whole. And two quarters make one half, and two eighths make one quarter, and two sixteenths make one eighth.",
  "lesson.9.June": "Okay, Yuuma, quiz time! A whole note corresponds to how many half notes together?$h#$e#...Yes, that's correct. I see Miss Penny is doing a good job of teaching fractions...$3",
  "lesson.10.Yuuma": "Four, five, and eight. And the major intervals are two, three, six, and seven, which is also the same as the minor.",
  "lesson.10.June": "Alright, since my last quiz was clearly too easy, I've prepared something a bit more challenging for today.$6#$b#In a major scale, which notes above the root are perfect intervals?#$e#...Man, Yuuma. I'm going to have to brush up on my music theory if I want to stump you, huh?$9",

And the real thing is so much more splendorous.$9", //John Keats, To Autumn

 	"Jio.MarriageDialogue.fall_26": "I've always found the locals' custom of donning costumes tomorrow night most peculiar.

 	"Jio.MarriageDialogue.Rainy_Day_3": "There's a certain poem from my childhood, one I would recite to myself whenever I found myself marching in the pouring rain. It was a mantra, of sorts, to take my mind off the wet and cold.#$b#\"I am the Poem of Earth... Eternal I rise impalpable out of the land and the bottomless sea, upward to heaven, whence, vaguely form'd, altogether changed, and yet the same, I descend...\"#$b#...But speaking it aloud now, I can't help but think of the effect your love has had on me... \"Altogether changed, and yet the same.\"$9", // Walt Whitman, The Voice of the Rain
 	"Jio.MarriageDialogue.Rainy_Day_4": "As a child in the Following, rain always dampened my spirits. It meant sleepless, shivering nights, wet clothes that stuck to skin like cement, monsters using its cover to ambush us...$s#$b#But now, with you, it means leisurely mornings in bed, tea by the fireplace... And in the evening, there's the smell of mist in your hair, droplets of water on your face for me to brush away with my lips...$9#$b#...Yes, this kind of rain is far superior, my harmony.$9",

You have my undivided attention now, so come - Show me what you intend to do with it.$9",
 	"Jio.MarriageDialogue.Rainy_Night_1": "Do you ever feel as if the rain is whispering its secrets to you amidst the downpour, my dearest?#$b#Listen carefully to its sighs... Can you hear it? How it urges me to take you in my arms and hold your body against mine, till the morning sun beckons us to wake...$9#$b#Well, darling, who am I to defy nature's decree?$9",
 	"Jio.MarriageDialogue.Rainy_Night_2-1": "There you are, my fairest. I brought this for you from my patrol in the Ridge Forest today.$1",
