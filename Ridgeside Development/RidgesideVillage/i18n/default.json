One day, this land that was once full of crops my wife and I cherished like children, will all be gone.^And when that day comes, I know my wife and I would have already went back to Yoba's arms and the walls might have come down.^^To whoever's reading this, this land is yours to take.^All I ask is you give it love as we did before.^May Yoba bless you.^^- R",

Houses were typically made of stone instead of the more common wood.^The people in the tribe believed in some sort of pond spirit, which they commonly depicted as an otter/seal hybrid.^Eventually, the village was destroyed -- most likely a group of ancient raiders.^^Around 700 years ago...^Early settlers came to the valley and set up a town along the coastline. That town is the Pelican Town we know today.^Pelican Town was orginally set up as a mining town, and eventually became a trading port as the time passed.^Originally, people flocked to Pelican Town as it was a great place for living off the land with the extremely fertile soil and abundant colonies of fish in the neighboring waters.^^Around 300 years ago until Present...^With an international war on the horizon, the state decided to build a new village in the mountains as refuge for civilians.^Some of the settlers in Pelican Town decided to live permanently in this new village -- And thus, Ridgeside Village was born.",
